# Form validation

Task - 1:
Prepare the contact form in which the user will enter their data:

<ul>
<li>name (input element)</li>
<li>email (input element)</li>
<li>short bio (textarea element)</li>
<li>gender selection - (radio element)</li>
<li>acceptance of the regulations (does not have to exist;) here we will use the checkbox element)</li>
</ul>

At the end of the form there should be a button for sending it. All fields are required, which means that the form cannot be sent until the user enters all the data and accepts the regulations.

If any field has not been filled in, the application will set a red border on this field and the message: "Required field" will appear below the field.

If all information has been entered, then all fields will be cleared (there will be no data in them), and the message "Thank you for sending" will appear on the screen

Task -2:
Complete this task 2 using the Formik or React Hook Form library

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
